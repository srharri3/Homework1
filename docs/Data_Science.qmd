# Questions:

-   I think being a data scientist is about collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data through visualizations.

-   I think data scientists are more focused on the coding and visualization part of analysis, while statisticians are more concerned with collecting data and performing mathematical analyses.

-   I am very new to both, but I would say I have more of a background in statistics than data science.

## R Code:

Assigning variable y as the density of the Petal.Width column of the iris table.

```{r var_assign}
y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)

class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)
```

Creating a plot for variable y.

```{r plot_y, echo=FALSE}
plot(y)
```
